# Freelancer App

I created a functional clone of the Fiverr Application to further enhance my skills in React and Express with Node js, this time incorporating a non relational database (MongoDB) in this case. This repo is the backend api.

Freelancer App helps connect freelancers with people looking to hire their services.
